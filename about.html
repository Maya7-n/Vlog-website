  <h1>About Realtek School</h1> 
  <p>Realtek School was founded in 1991 by Alejandro de Janeiro in Nairobi,Kenya. Alejandro was born in 1889 to a poor family
    as a citizen of Kenya. His parents could barely afford a meal as they were going by. Alejandro had to work part time 
    to support his family as he couldn't afford school. As he grew up,he realised that school was important and his number 
    one desire was to build a school to help peolple like him not to miss the chance to explore school. He grew up to be a 
    hard working man and toghether with his friend Dante they started a projet to build a school in 1982. His friend sadly 
    died in 1985 due to pneumonia. Alejandro was very heartbroken and decided to dedicate the school to his beloved friend 
    The amazing person died in 2002 due to old age. What an amazing story!
